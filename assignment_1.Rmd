```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE)
```

Here’s what you should prepare: A single polished HTML (knitted from .Rmd), planning that this might be a post/project you’d include on your personal blogdown site, that includes at least:

1) A useful descriptive introductory summary (3 - 4 sentences) of what’s contained in the project

2) Image(s), with captions and necessary citation(s), of showshoe hares and/or a map of the study area

3) All of your organized and well-annotated code (with warnings/messages hidden) used to create at least:

One finalized graph about the Bonanza Creek snowshoe hare population (you pick which variables, how you want to wrangle it beforehand, and which type of visual to create - but make sure it is beautifully finalized)

One finalized HTML table (probably created using kable & kableExtra) containing summary statistics about the snowshoe hares (again, you pick which variables, and how you want to group/summarize them)

4) Make sure that both your figure and table appear in your final knitted document, each with a useful caption. Include text associated with each to help the audience understand and interpret the results. 

```{r}

# Load necessary packages

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(kableExtra)

```

```{r}

# Read in the data: Snowshoe hare physical data in Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest: 1999-Present

# Weight is in grams

snowshoe <- read_csv("showshoe_lter.csv")

```
